# Datum + Sanity

This repo holds a small page with a form for registering for a marketing newsletter. For information regarding the underlying template repository used, see the [upstream].

This starter was originally preconfigured to support Visual Editing, a new feature that enables you to make changes using Vercel's draft mode and new edit functionality. It is a statically generated personal website that uses Next.js for the frontend and Sanity to handle its content.
